# Week 01 – Initial Observations on Beacon-based Localization in Fire Scenarios

## 1. Initial Expectation
I initially assumed that improving beacon placement density
would directly improve localization accuracy,
even in emergency or fire scenarios.

## 2. Observation
During preliminary thinking and review of prior BLE-based systems,
I noticed that most localization methods assume:
- stable signal propagation
- static environments
- intact infrastructure

However, in fire or disaster scenarios:
- Beacons may be damaged or blocked
- RSSI values fluctuate abnormally due to smoke, heat, and human movement
- The system still outputs a confident location estimate
even when the signal quality is clearly degraded.

## 3. Why This Matters
In evacuation systems, a confidently wrong location estimate
can guide users toward hazardous areas.
This suggests that higher geometric accuracy alone
does not guarantee safer evacuation decisions.

## 4. Open Questions
- How can a system detect when localization confidence should be reduced?
- Is it safer to output a region or multiple hypotheses instead of a single point?
- How should evacuation guidance change when localization uncertainty increases?
