# Risk-Aware Evacuation under Localization Uncertainty

## Motivation
In emergency evacuation, inaccurate localization can be more dangerous than delayed guidance.
Shortest paths may lead occupants into hazardous or congested areas.

## Key Insight
Localization error in indoor environments is not random noise but structural ambiguity
(e.g., stairs, floors, human obstruction).

## Problem Statement
How can an evacuation system plan safe routes when user location is uncertain?

## Core Idea
- Avoid shortcut-based routing
- Use conservative, confidence-aware localization
- Prioritize safety over speed

## System Perspective
- Localization provides probability regions, not exact positions
- Path planning accounts for uncertainty and risk
- Guidance favors robustness over optimality

## Research Direction
- Uncertainty-aware localization
- Risk-aware path planning
- Safety-critical system design

## Status
Conceptual system design & research framing
